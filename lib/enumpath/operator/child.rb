# frozen_string_literal: true

# Implements JSONPath child operator syntax. In a non-normalized path a child operator
# is preceded by `.` or wrapped in '[]'. In a normalized path the child operator is the
# segment that followed the `.` or that was contained within the '[]'. In bracket notation
# the child may optionally be wrapped in single quotes. If the child operator matches a
# index, key, member, or property of the enumerable, it is yielded to the block.
